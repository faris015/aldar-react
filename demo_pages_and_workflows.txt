2) Suggested Demo Workflows (High Level)

Workflow 1: Secure Access
Login / Register -> Role assignment (RBAC) -> Permission check -> Access granted -> Audit log entry

Workflow 2: Document Upload & Metadata
Select project/folder -> Upload file (PDF/DWG/DOC) -> Enter metadata (discipline/status/revision/date) -> Save to register

Workflow 3: Review & Approval
Document in WIP -> Review task assigned -> Approve/Reject comments -> Move to Shared/Published -> Notify stakeholders

Workflow 4: Revision Control
Published document updated -> New revision uploaded -> Version comparison/history updated -> Old revision retained

Workflow 5: Quality & Compliance
Run quality/compliance checks -> Raise non-conformance if issues found -> Assign corrective action -> Close on validation

Workflow 6: Transmittal & Correspondence
Create formal transmittal -> Attach linked documents/revisions -> Send to external/internal recipients -> Track acknowledgment

Workflow 7: Integration Sync
Approved/published data -> Sync to BIM/PM/ERP/CAFM connectors -> Validate sync status -> Log results

Workflow 8: Archive & Handover
Project closeout trigger -> Compile as-built docs + asset data + O&M manuals -> Move to long-term archive

Workflow 9: Audit & Traceability
Any critical action (login, upload, review, approval, revision, transmittal) -> Capture timestamp/user/action -> View in audit logs


3) Minimal Demo Navigation (Recommended)
Dashboard -> Documents -> Workflow -> Quality -> Transmittals -> Integrations -> Archive -> Admin (Users/Roles/Audit)
